# FlexReports Lifecycle.
This script demonstrates working with graphQL apis to manage the lifecycle of a FlexReport. In this example, we will:
- Generate an access token from an API key
- Create a FlexReport
- Poll the status of the FlexReport we created until it is ready
- Download a CSV of the FlexReport we created, rename and save this file to the current working directory
- Delete the FlexReport we just created.
